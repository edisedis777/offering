# Ancestral Joss Paper Offering

## [Demo here](https://edisedis777.github.io/offering/)

A visually stunning and culturally rich webpage project that allows users to perform a virtual ancestral offering by "burning" a joss paper. Inspired by traditional East Asian ancestral worship practices, this interactive experience features artistic animations, a mystical atmosphere, rich audio, and mobile-friendly design.

## Overview
This project creates a digital ritual where users can click a beautifully designed joss paper or the "Burn" button to watch it fade away in a poetic, flame-and-smoke animation, symbolizing an offering to ancestors. The design emphasizes cultural authenticity with traditional motifs, a yellow parchment-like joss paper, and subtle patterns, set against a misty temple background.

## Features
* Artistic Design: A small joss paper with minimal traditional motifs.
* Interactive Burning: Click the joss paper or "Burn" button to trigger a layered burn effect with painterly flames, swirling smoke, and glowing embers, fading without floating upward for a solemn, artistic experience.
* Mobile-Friendly: Fully responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop screens, with a title, instructions, and a "Burn" button.
* Cultural Depth: Incorporates traditional East Asian symbolism, ethereal background gradients, and a spirit transition to evoke the spiritual essence of ancestral worship.
* Animations: Uses HTML5 Canvas for high-quality, performance-optimized particle animations, with subtle effects like trembling before burning and a fading spirit silhouette.
